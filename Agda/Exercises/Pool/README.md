A pool of Agda exercises originally intended for lab sessions and homework in
the module "Advanced Functional Programming" at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx)
of the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), UK.

These exercises were created together with
[Ayberk Tosun](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axt978/) and
[Todd Waugh Ambridge](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~txw467/).


In general (but not always) the [Homework](Homework) exercises were designed
to be a little more challenging than the exercises selected for the [Lab](Lab).
The numbers in the file names, e.g. `Lab4.lagda.md`, mark the week numbers of
the original module. Thus, a higher number typically indicates more advanced
exercises.

All exercises are solved in a corresponding file marked with the suffix
`-solutions.lagda.md`.
