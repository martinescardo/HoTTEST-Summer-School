# Propositions as types and basic Martin-Löf type theory

We now complete the proposition-as-types interpretation of logic.

## Remarks

 * (*) Not only the unit type 𝟙, but also any type with at least one element can be regarded as "true" in the propositions-as-types interpretation.

 * In Agda we can use any notation we like, of course, and people do use slightly different notatations for e.g. `𝟘`, `𝟏`, `+` and `Σ`.

 * We will refer to the above type theory together with the type `ℕ` of natural numbers as *Basic Martin-Löf Type Theory*.

 * As we will see, this type theory is very expressive and allows us to construct rather sophisticated types, including e.g. lists, vectors and trees.

 * All types in MLTT ([Martin-Löf type theory](http://archive-pml.github.io/martin-lof/pdfs/Bibliopolis-Book-1984.pdf)) come with *introduction* and *elimination* principles.
