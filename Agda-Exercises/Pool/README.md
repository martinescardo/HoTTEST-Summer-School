A pool of Agda exercises originally intended for lab sessions and homework in
the module "Advanced Functional Programming" at the School of Computer Science
of the University of Birmingham, UK.

These exercises were created together with
[Ayberk Tosun](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axt978/) and
[Todd Waugh Ambridge](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~txw467/).


In general (but not always) the [Homework](Homework) exercises were designed
to be a little more challenging than the exercises selected for the [Lab](Lab).
The numbers in the file names, e.g. `Lab4.lagda.md`, mark the week numbers of
the original module. Thus, a higher number typically indicates more advanced
exercises.

All exercises are solved in a corresponding file marked with the suffix
`-solutions.lagda.md`.
